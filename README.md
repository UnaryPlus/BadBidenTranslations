# Bad Biden Translations
This is the Python code for a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/badbidentrans) that posts bad translations of the president's tweets. It uses google translate to convert the text into five random languages, and then back into English. I'm not trying to make a political statement or anything, I just thought it would be funny.
